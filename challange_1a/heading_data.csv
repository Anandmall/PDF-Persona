1.  Introduction to the Foundation Level Extensions,H1
This overview document is intended for anyone with an interest in the ISTQB Foundation Level,H1
Extensions who wants a high-level introduction to the leading principles and an overview of the individual,H1
extension syllabi.,H1
"From time to time, ISTQB will update this document to reflect any additional extensions that shall be",H1
"introduced for the Foundation Level, or to reflect major changes in existing ones. Publications of the",H1
updated document will be available on the ISTQB website.,H1
The ISTQB Foundation and Advanced Level syllabi have been defined and have been on the market for,H1
some time. New topics emerge due to technology and methodology changes in the market which often,H1
"are brought into the ISTQB program as new Expert Level syllabi. However, not all topics are suited for the",H1
"Expert Level. For this reason, the extension syllabi are established at the Foundation Level to expand the",H1
ISTQB program to incorporate new or updated knowledge. New extensions shall be discussed and,H1
"introduced by the ISTQB periodically. Extensions may be established at the Advanced Level as well, but",H1
that is beyond the scope of this document.,H1
The following Foundation Level Extension syllabus has been released:,H1
Agile Tester,H1
"In this document, each Foundation Level Extension syllabus is summarized and the associated Business",H1
Outcomes are stated. The Business Outcomes communicate what can be expected from a person who,H1
"achieves a Foundation Level Extension Certification in a particular subject area (e.g., Agile Tester), and",H1
will outline the benefits for companies that are considering the development of specific testing skills at this,H1
Page 6 of 12,H1
2.  Introduction to Foundation Level Agile Tester Extension,H1
The certification for Foundation Level Extension –   Agile Tester is designed for professionals who are,H1
working within Agile environments. It is also for professionals who are planning to start implementing,H1
"Agile methods in the near future, or are working within companies that plan to do so, The certification",H1
"provides an advantage for those who would like to know the required Agile activities, roles, methods, and",H1
methodologies specific to their role.,H1
2.1 Intended Audience,H2
The Foundation Level Extension –   Agile Tester qualification is aimed at four main groups of professionals:,H1
1. Professionals who have achieved in-depth testing experience in traditional methods and would,H1
like to get an Agile Tester Certificate.,H1
"2. Junior professional testers who are just starting in the testing profession, have received the",H1
"Foundation Level certificate, and would like to know more about   the   tester’s   role in an Agile",H1
"3. Professionals who are relatively new to testing and are required to implement test approaches,",H1
methods and techniques in their day to day job in Agile projects.,H1
4. Professionals who are experienced in their role (including unit testing) and need more,H1
understanding and knowledge about how to perform and manage testing on all levels in Agile,H1
"These professionals include people who are in roles such as testers, test analysts, test engineers, test",H1
"consultants, test managers, user acceptance testers, and software developers.",H1
This Foundation Level Extension –   Agile Tester certification may also be appropriate for anyone who,H1
"wants a deeper understanding of software testing in the Agile world, such as project managers, quality",H1
"managers, software development managers, business analysts, IT directors, and management",H1
2.2 Career Paths for Testers,H2
"Building on the Foundation Level, the Agile Tester Extension supports the definition of career paths for",H1
professional testers. A person with the Agile Tester certificate has extended the broad understanding of,H1
testing acquired at the Foundation Level to enable him or her to work effectively as a professional tester in,H1
an Agile project.,H1
People possessing an ISTQB Foundation Level Extension –   Agile Tester certificate may use the Certified,H1
Tester Foundation Level acronym CTFL-AT.,H1
2.3 Learning Objectives,H2
"In general, the Foundation Level syllabus is examinable at a K1 level, i.e., the candidate will recognize,",H1
remember and recall terms and concepts stated in the Foundation Level syllabus.,H1
"In addition, all Foundation Level syllabus learning objectives are examinable at the same K- level in an",H1
extension exam.,H1
Page 7 of 12,H1
"That said, each extension level exam focuses on the learning objectives defined in that extension",H1
"syllabus. The relevant learning objectives at K1, K2, and K3 levels are provided at the beginning of each",H1
chapter within each particular extension syllabus.,H1
2.4 Entry Requirements,H2
"To be able to participate in a Foundation Level Extension –   Agile Tester exam, candidates must have",H1
obtained the ISTQB Foundation Level certificate.,H1

"First, some background on the ODL. For the last two years the Ontario Library Association",H1
"has acted as a catalyst, bringing together the stakeholders needed to create the Ontario",H1
"Digital Library (ODL). These stakeholders include Ontario’s 5000+ public libraries, university,",H1
"college, and school libraries, as well as Ontario government ministries.",H1
Libraries that serve very different clientele recognize that by working together they can create,H1
"seamless access to quality electronic library services. Through the ODL, students will be",H1
"able to explore a topic at school, use the same child-safe resources after school (either at",H1
"home or at a public library), enter college or university with a knowledge of how to use",H1
"electronic resources that are still available and then, after graduation, continue to use these",H1
skills and resources at work or at home.,H1
We are moving into a period of convergence. With convergence we no longer have to license,H1
commercial products as individual libraries or institutions. We can work together to spend our,H1
money wisely. The provincial government has made this possible by working hard to provide,H1
"all Ontarians with a stable, high-speed communications infrastructure. While there is still a",H1
"great deal of work needed to improve this infrastructure, libraries are beginning to plan how",H1
best to exploit communications technology. We can reduce barriers to access and create the,H1
content infrastructure needed to support a knowledge society.,H1
"The concept of an ODL is a key element in  The Roadmap to Prosperity , a strategic plan to",H1
envision and attain Ontario’s economic goal prepared by the Ontario Jobs and Investment,H1
Board. The OJIB strategic plan recommends an electronic library to “connect students to new,H1
"workplaces, new sources of information and applied learning opportunities”. The ODL will do",H1
"that and much more. The ODL will connect students to electronic information, and will also",H1
leverage this investment to help connect all citizens to the electronic information they need as,H1
"they make decisions, solve problems and enhance their quality of life.",H1
Libraries have long been a key delivery point for public services. The ODL will allow that,H1
"delivery point to move closer to citizens, into the smallest of libraries and even into living",H1
"Libraries have a long tradition of using a practical, consultative approach to solving problems,",H1
and of learning from others. The ODL is a very practical solution to various problems.,H1
Jurisdiction-wide digital libraries are very practical and very real. The ODL we propose is,H1
leading edge for Ontario but several jurisdictions have forged the path with collaborative,H1
"digital libraries. We can learn from their experiences. For example, The Alberta Library (TAL)",H1
was incorporated in 1997 as a province-wide library consortium. TAL works collaboratively,H1
with its members to promote universal access to materials and resources in more than 250,H1
"public, post-secondary, special, government and regional libraries. Unlike ODL, TAL does",H1
"not include elementary or secondary schools. However, the timeline and funding we are",H1
proposing for ODL is comparable to TAL‘s experience. TAL’s business planning took several,H1
years. TAL’s implementation plan was supported by 8 million dollars in provincially shared,H1
"funding, spread over three years, later revised to 15 million dollars over 4 years. Not only is",H1
"Alberta’s population 30% of Ontario’s, TAL does not include elementary or secondary",H1
schools as partners; it has 250 member libraries. ODL envisions universal access for all,H1
"10,000,000 Ontarians, with more than 5000 Ontario libraries as partners. Although ODL can",H1
"learn from TAL’s practices, the scope of planning and implementing ODL is much larger than",H1
The ODL will be a partnership-based organization providing seamless electronic information,H1
services and resources to the citizens of Ontario. It will use local libraries as the entry point for,H1
common resources The ODL will recognize the unique responsibilities and needs of public,H1
"libraries, school libraries, college and university libraries and special libraries. The ODL",H1
"envisions a digital network of information resources, allowing members to collaborate when",H1
there is mutual benefit and to support the common mandates of local libraries.,H1
The principles which will define and guide the ODL are:,H1
Equitable access for all Ontarians:,H1
"We will bring consistent, high-quality electronic resources and services to 10 million",H1
Ontario citizens,H1
We will eliminate barriers to the access to information and create more consistent,H1
services for library clients.,H1
Shared decision-making and accountability:,H1
We will facilitate consensus among members regarding ODL’s portfolio of electronic,H1
licenses and services,H1
We will balance the interests and realities of small and large as well as rich and poor,H1
communities and institutions.,H1
Shared governance structure:,H1
We will share decision-making in order to enable the people we serve.,H1
We will work based on an underlying assumption of trust and synergy.,H1
Shared funding:,H1
"We will leverage provincial, institutional, and local dollars to realize economies of scale",H1
and put Ontario dollars to work for everyone .,H1
We will be willing to pool talents and dollars in order to provide common services that are,H1
truly greater than those that can be maintained by individual institutions.,H1
Local points of entry:,H1
"We will provide the licenses, infrastructure, services and support that enable local",H1
"libraries to provide exceptional services to their clientele. ODL will focus on support,",H1
"providing the underpinning, not overshadowing.",H1
Services envisioned for the ODL’s include:,H1
Access:,H1
"to the “deep” web (i.e. Commercial, purchased electronic services)",H1
to credible web sites and electronic resources,H1
to digital government information,H1
to local digital collections,H1
Guidance and Advice:,H1
to support e-learning,H1
"to support citizens, in real-time, as they try to use electronic resources",H1
to assist citizens as they use web-links,H1
Training:,H1
for library workers,H1
for the general public,H1
Provincial Purchasing & Licensing:,H1
of electronic content on a consortia basis for all member libraries,H1
Technological Support:,H1
of common standards for the preservation and archiving local digital content,H1
of a common interface to ODL resources and services that can be imbedded in local,H1
library web sites,H1
What could the ODL really mean?,H1
For each Ontario citizen it could mean:,H1
One local point of entry to access seamless electronic library services and,H1
"resources for their personal, educational and professional needs;",H1
"Access to credible, high-quality, user-friendly electronic services through their",H1
"community, school, or academic library;",H1
Confidence that the electronic services and sources they – and their children,H1
"– are using are safe, valid, and bringing them both global and local",H1
Electronic information and tools that enhance job skills and the learning,H1
For each Ontario student it could mean:,H1
"One local point of entry to quality, curriculum- based electronic information",H1
resources and services,H1
"Connection to their individual educational environment, whether at the",H1
"elementary, secondary or post-secondary levels",H1
"Confidence that the services and resources people are using are credible,",H1
available when they need them and adaptable to different learning styles,H1
For each Ontario library it could mean:,H1
One point of entry for themselves and their clientele to quality electronic,H1
"resources and services that support and enhance their collections, programs",H1
and services,H1
"The opportunity to show case their local community, collections, services, and",H1
"The opportunity to gain from the provincial, collaborative partnership in order",H1
to provide a seamless gateway to digital resources and services,H1
For the Ontario government it could mean:,H1
"A  point of entry to information services and resources for all Ontario citizens,",H1
connecting to portal initiatives .,H1
Support of the Ontario E-Learning strategy through a collaborative digital,H1
library initiative that positions Ontario on the global e-learning scene,H1
Improved access and flexibility for all students at all ages and stages,H1
(supports Ontario’s lifelong learning strategy),H1
The opportunity to address emerging job skills shortages and facilitate school,H1
to work and job to job transitions with the necessary information and,H1
knowledge supports and tools,H1
ODL will be an incorporated non-profit organization governed by a Board of Directors elected,H1
by a voting membership. The Board will include representatives from all stakeholders. We,H1
envision a governance model similar to that prepared for the province’s ORION network.,H1
"More information regarding the envisioned phasing, funding and resources required for the",H1
ODL can be found in the appendixes.,H1
The business plan which needs to be developed for the ODL must be a formal business plan,H1
"that documents and clearly communicates the ODL’s services, funding and governance",H1
"structures, as well as implementation plans for 2004-2005, and operational plans for 2005-",H1
"2007. The planning process must also secure the full commitment of all stakeholders, as",H1
represented on the Steering Committee.,H1
"Specifically, the business plan must include:",H1
the commitment of all stakeholders to their responsibilities,H1
The process of developing this business plan must be extremely consultative to ensure that,H1
all stakeholders are engaged in creating a synergistic ODL organization.  The proposal must,H1
indicate how this consultative process will be approached.,H1
"The business plan for the ODL must address significant issues. There are, for example,",H1
enormous differences in the financial resources available to libraries mandated to provide,H1
"similar services. Some post-secondary and public libraries, particularly those in large urban",H1
"areas, have the facilities, funding and technological infrastructure necessary to service their",H1
"patrons with electronic services and resources.  Many others, particularly in rural regions, do",H1
not.  The proposal must indicate how these issues will be approached.,H1
1) A preliminary report will be issued during June 2003.,H1
"2) It is expected that an Interim Report, suitable for distribution to the broader library",H1
"community will be available by August 1, 2003 and that there will be an opportunity",H1
for responses to be evaluated.,H1
3) The business plan must be completed and approved by the ODL Steering Committee,H1
"no later than September 30, 2003.",H1
The firm/consultant  (or proposed team of consultants)  will be expected to work closely with,H1
the ODL Steering Committee. Terms of reference for the Committee are in the appendix.,H1
"Given the consultative nature of this business planning process, the firm/consultant will also",H1
be expected to travel and communicate regularly with various stakeholders as well as with,H1
electronic resource publishers/vendors.,H1
The proposal should include the following information:,H1
a) name of the firm/consultant,H1
"b) names of those individuals who will be engaged in this project, their specific",H1
responsibilities on this project and relevant experience/qualifications,H1
c) description of similar engagements that highlight the firm’s experience in business,H1
planning and building stakeholder commitment,H1
d) references with details of work completed for these references,H1

Phase I:  Business Planning,H2
Timeline:  March 2003 – September 2003,H2
"Funding Requested:  ~$100,000 jointly funded by stakeholder groups and the provincial government.",H2
Result:  The ODL business plan,H2
"The first phase will be to build the ODL business plan. This plan will clearly define the ODL’s services,",H2
"funding and governance structures, as well as implementation plans for 2003-2005. It will also secure",H2
the full commitment of all stakeholders and scope the operational plan for ODL for 2006 and beyond.,H2
"Given the number and diversity of stakeholders involved, the business planning process must be a fully",H2
consultative approach. To ensure that the planning results in a workable plan with the full commitment,H2
"of all stakeholders it must have competent, dedicated staffing and monies for the travel and",H2
communication components so critical in a consultative process.,H2
Phase II: Implementing and Transitioning,H2
Timeline:  April 2004 – December 2006,H2
Funding Requested:  Funding from other states and provinces suggest that the ODL could receive,H2
"funding of up to $50 Million (over 3 years). Funding to be provided partnership of government, library",H2
stakeholders and other interested parties.,H2
Result:  The ODL is implemented and validated,H2
The second phase will be to implement the ODL based on the business plan. This phase recognizes,H2
that for ODL to be optimally successful libraries must transition to a new way of doing business and,H2
providing services. The transition must occur while libraries continue to provide existing services and,H2
"respond to current challenges. This implementation phase will funded by a partnership of government,",H2
library stakeholders and other interested parties as a means to quickly jumpstart the ODL.,H2
The seed money requested will allow libraries to realign their budgets and services as the infrastructure,H2
"and content of the ODL is created and secured.  Some of the funding will be new money, although there",H2
is every indication that existing budgets and methods of operating may be modified as a result of,H2
"recommendations . During this phase the polices, procedures, governance structures and accountability",H2
"mechanisms of the ODL will be put in place. Pilot projects will be initiated, evaluated and expanded.",H2
"Information resources will be identified, contracts for these resources will be negotiated and resources",H2
will be made deployed through the ODL. Regular evaluation during this phase will ensure the ODL is,H2
achieving its objectives and is accountable to its key communities.,H2
Phase III: Operating and Growing the ODL,H2
Timeline:  January 2007 -,H2
Funding:  $50 Million annually ($35 Million requested from government),H2
Result:  The ODL is fully operational and sustainable,H2
In the third phase the ODL moves into the operational stage. Ontarians will experience the full benefits,H2
of the initiative and libraries will consolidate support around the ODL to grow resources and extend,H2
capabilities. The challenge is to secure resources sufficient to both sustain the original investments and,H2
to enhance the ODL.,H2
The ongoing funding of the ODL will be based on a partnership model involving all the key participants,H2
"(i.e. government, libraries, donors, public and private sectors). All participants (i.e. beneficiaries) are",H2
expected to make financial contributions to the ODL. It is important in achieving the full impact of the,H2
"ODL on Ontario’s economy, society and learning support that all library sectors are participants",H2
"(university, colleges, public libraries and schools).",H2
"The proposed funding model requires a continuing government investment, but also recognizes that as",H2
the ODL matures a growing share of ODL funding will come from libraries and non-governmental,H2
sources. During the 3-year implementation phase (2004 – 2006) libraries will realign their budgets to,H2
enable ongoing funding contributions to ODL. During the same period ODL must build the proposed,H2
endowment and secure public and private sector gifts and/or in-kind contributions. The following chart,H2
outlines the model. This model is based on these assumptions:,H2
1. that ODL expenditures will increase by 50% over a 10 year period,H1
2. that government funding will decrease from 70% to 45% during that 10 year period,H1
"3. that library contributions, endowment and gifts/in-kind funding will increase from 30% to 55%",H1
during the same period,H2

TOTAL ANNUAL,H2
"While the private sector will be invited to participate in the ODL through the endowment, gifts and in-",H2
"kind contributions, the ODL will also explore compatible commercial services which leverage the reach",H2
of the ODL and help to offset operating costs.,H2
A $50M budget leverages the consortium buying power of the province’s libraries to secure the best,H2
"prices for information resources, the widest accessibility and the most favourable contracts. A budget of",H2
this nature will ensure a core digital collection of sufficient scope and coverage to address a substantial,H2
amount of the wide and diverse information and learning needs of the citizens of Ontario (an overview,H2
of the nature of the ODL digital collection is appended).  The proposed ODL expenditures in 2006,H2
represent an investment of $5.00 per citizen.,H2
It is important to recognize that every new dollar per citizen invested in the Ontario Digital Library has a,H2
double benefit: it supports a province-wide library of high quality information resources and it,H2
strengthens every local library in Ontario by allowing them to reinvest existing dollars in new resources,H2
that enhance local services.  This multiplier means that for every dollar invested in ODL the return,H2
on investment is worth $2 of value for Ontario.,H2
